## Recipe Search Application Using React 16.10 
   - This is a simple application to consume REST API's from developer.edamam.com to search recipes using a given search keyword. 
   The front-end will query for 'chicken' by default when the app first renders, and user can search for other keywords such as 'noodles',
   'banana' etc.. 
   
   - The app demonstrates use of 
   1. Stateful and Stateless React Components
   2. Lifecycle hooks ( componentWillMount(), componentDidUpdate() )
   3. Passing Properties down to child components.
   4. Styling of page using css
   5. List Rendering 
   6. Form submission
